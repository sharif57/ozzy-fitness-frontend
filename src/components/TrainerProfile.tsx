              Former division one college football player and experienced elite
              athlete, I bring to OEG Stretching Strength a combination of my
              passion for sports, fitness, and healing achieved through a career
              competing in track, football, basketball, as well as personal
              recovery from sports-related injuries.

            <p className="text-[18px] font-normal text-[#545454] mt-4 leading-relaxed">
              While sports had always been present in my life since a young age,
              the desire for healing was equally important. As a small child, I
              wanted to be a doctor, telling my sick grandmother "I'm going to
              fix you." Sports and healing were a natural complement, and these
              two things were realized when I received a football scholarship
              from Oklahoma State University. This was an opportunity to compete
              in sports on a collegiate level, while earning a Bachelor of
              Science in Health Wellness.

              With sports comes injury, both during and after college â€“ right
              shoulder surgery, umbilical hernia surgery, medial and lateral
              injuries to both knees. Throughout the recovery process, I
              continued to train in the gym and work through these injuries,
              later receiving extensive education in personal training,
              Olympic-style lifting, TRX, Bosu, and other systems.

              As a young athlete, I witnessed fundamental things missing from a
              lot of training programs, such as nutrition, hydration,
              stretching, and proper warm-up and cool-down. To this day, many
              young athletes, including pro athletes, drink sodium-filled sports
              drinks thinking they are making healthy decisions. How wrong they
              are, and I was once one of them.
